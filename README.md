"# Code description" 
The source code python file provides the pipeline of exploratory data analysis and establishing mahcine learning models for predicting airplan delays. 
The methodology processes in the code are: data collection, data preprocessing, data visulisation, features engineering, model training and evaluation.
The users are expected to find out the multiple factors that caused flight delays, some relationships and patterns from historical data.
Finally, the output of desired machine learning models will provide prediction on the probability of delay for eachh fligh.
